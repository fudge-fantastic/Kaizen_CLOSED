# Kaizen (改善) 

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Package the Application**  
   Begin by developing and packaging your machine learning application. This includes creating a deployable package containing the model, dependencies, and any necessary scripts or configurations.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation using MLFlow**  
   Use MLFlow to manage the machine learning lifecycle. Train and evaluate multiple models to identify the best-performing one. Track experiments, hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts. Once the optimal model is identified, save it as an artifact for deployment.

3. **Develop the Application Interface (Flask or FastAPI)**  
   Build a RESTful API using either Flask or FastAPI. The API will serve the machine learning model, allowing external systems to interact with it for predictions.

4. **Containerize the Application with Docker**  
   Create a Dockerfile to containerize the entire application, including the API, model, and dependencies. This ensures consistent behavior across different environments, from development to production.

5. **Implement CI/CD for Automated Deployment**  
   Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI. This will automate the testing, building, and deployment of your containerized application to the desired environment.

6. **Configure GitHub Webhooks**  
   Integrate GitHub with your CI/CD pipeline by setting up webhooks. This will trigger the CI/CD pipeline automatically when changes are pushed to the repository, ensuring a smooth deployment process.

7. **Set Up Jenkins for Deployment Automation**  
   Configure Jenkins to orchestrate the deployment process. Set up a Jenkins project that triggers the deployment when changes are detected in the repository or based on other defined conditions.

8. **Test and Monitor the Deployed Application**  
   Once deployed, test the application to ensure it is functioning as expected. Monitor the application’s performance, scalability, and availability using tools like Prometheus or Grafana to ensure smooth operation.
